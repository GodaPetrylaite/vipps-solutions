# Parking

üí• DRAFT! Unfinished work in progress. üí•

There are many ways to use Vipps for paying for parking.

One way is to use the
[Recurring API](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/recurring-api)
and
[Recurring agreements with variable amount](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/recurring-api/vipps-recurring-api#recurring-agreements-with-variable-amount):

1. The user enters an Agreement as usual. See
   [Create an agreement](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/recurring-api/vipps-recurring-api#create-an-agreement).
2. The user parks one or more times.
3. The accumulated parking fees are used to create one charge with the
   accumulated amount. See:
   [Create a charge](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/recurring-api/vipps-recurring-api#create-a-charge).
