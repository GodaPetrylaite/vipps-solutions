# Electric vehicle charging

ðŸ’¥ TODO. This is just a placeholder for now. ðŸ’¥

Vipps is an excellent choice for EV charging as practically all Norwegians have
the Vipps app in their pocket, simplifying charging with out downloading a
specific charging app.

Implemented correctly, EV charging with Vipps, is a simple and efficient
solution that let's your customers use your charging network with no hassle.

Drop in charging with Vipps is best implemented using QR codes, scanned either
with the Vipps app or the phone's camera. Vipps provides a
[QR API](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/qr-api)
that can be used in combination with the Vipps eCom API to set up and start a
Vipps payment.
